# Project Sophist
## Introduction
### Philosophy
- All people should have the capability to pursue truth. Knowledge should be transparent and accessible. Those that wish to pass on what they have learned ought to have a platform on which to find dedicated students. Transactions should be transparent and algorithmic, with core values of the business dictated by the most passionate contributers to the project. 
- All people are capable of learning any subject, given a sufficiently skilled teacher. Furthermore, the efficacy of teaching is maximized when the student's individuality is taken into consideration. 
- Teachers should primarily teach students to *love* the subject they teach. Students should primary teach teachers *how* to communicate this love.
- All monetary transactions are *seperate* from the platform.

### Format
- The platform will consist of a set of unified algorithms based on a few well defined classes of metrics which follow a given set of generalized rules. All people can create their own metrics, as long as it satisfies these rules. 
- I have thought of three classes of metrics I consider most important
	- Compatibility Metrics
		- Metrics that measure compatibility between student and teacher
			- Should be *research based* with a focus on the *student's* learning method
			- Metrics given to the teacher only help inform student recommendations, but the teacher should decide if a student is to be accepted based on an introductory *meeting*. The metrics are only to aid the process of matching a student with a teacher.
			- Out of these metrics, the teacher can post what metric they subscribe to most philisophically. There should be a constantly updating guide on the philosophy and motivations of each metric by the author. The student can fill out whichever metrics he/she agrees with most, and those will be saved. Answers to these metrics can be changed at any time. 
			- All metrics should be neutral. These should be purely psychological questions *without emotional/personal bias*. In other words, the language in which the metric is given must be an assessment of the individual in terms of *learning style* instead of *learning capability* because of our assumption that all people are *capable* of learning *any* subject.
	- Logistical Metrics
		- Metrics that determine control over the platform
			- Should be contribution based with a corresponding contribution metric
			- Contribution metrics should be *purely data driven* but can be written by anyone so long as they follow a certain set of agreed rules (input must be some dataset with output in this format, etc...) 
			- All submitted and validated contribution metrics will be weighted equally
				- Validation will occur via voting by the whole platform
			- Permissions one has over the repisotory depends on an algorithm which takes in as input the contribution metric and other perhaps relevant metrics
		- Metrics that determine pricing
			- These metrics should *NOT* include academic achievement, but rather based solely on *individual approaches*
			- A teacher can determine his/her own metric, but there can also be standardized ones based on well accepted algorithms
			- Metrics do not have to include money. Teachers can give free tutoring if the student is worth it
	- Response Metrics
		- Metrics that measure student response. Large scale data analysis of these metrics will determine the data that goes into a contribution metric
		- Highest weighted response metrics will depend on a vote from the community
- NOTE
	- Unless absolutely necessary, distinguishments against "subjects" should be avoided. A teacher teaches a *variety* of subjects, depending on the passions of the teacher. Part of the teacher's role is as not only a giver of knowledge, but also as one who guides development

### Standard Curriculum

There will be an *open source* library (categorized accordingly) of academic resources *written by members of the community* that *anyone* can access, though they *must* be checked by experts in the field. Furthermore, there should be *standard curriculum*s (written by members of the community) that teaches a fundamental set of knowledge. Graduate level teaching should also be accessible to those who desire it. No knowledge is off the table.
